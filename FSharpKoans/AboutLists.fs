// About Lists
//
// Lists are important building blocks that you'll use frequently
// in F# programming. They are used to group arbitrarily large 
// sequences of values. It's very common to store values in a 
// list and perform operations across each value in the 
// list.

       immutable. With that in mind, what does the @ function have to do in
