           tuples containing two elements. It's usually better to use a 
           technique called pattern matching to access the values of a tuple. 
           
           Pattern matching works with tuples of any arity, and it allows you to 
           simultaneously break apart the tuple while assigning a name to each 
           value. Here's an example. *)
